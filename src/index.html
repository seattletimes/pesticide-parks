        <h1>Pesticides in Seattle parks</h1>
        <div class="chatter">
          Seattle sprays thousands of gallons of pesticide mixes each year in developed parks around the city. Click on a park to see a summary of pesticide sprayings over the past decade. You can also see how much pesticide usage involved Tier 1 products -- considered the most hazardous â€“ and how much involved products with the active ingredient glyphosate.
